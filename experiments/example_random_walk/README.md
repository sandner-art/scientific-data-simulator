 # Example Random Walk Experiment

This directory contains the `ExperimentLogic` implementation for a 1D random walk simulation.

## Files

* `logic.py`: Contains the `RandomWalkExperiment` class.

## Model Description

The simulation performs a 1D random walk with a configurable number of steps and step size.  At each step, the position is updated by either +step_size or -step_size with equal probability.
