# Example Experiment: Sine Wave

This directory contains the `ExperimentLogic` implementation for a simple sine wave simulation.

## Files

*   `logic.py`: Contains the `ExampleExperiment` class, which implements the `ExperimentLogic` interface.

## Model Description

The simulation generates a sine wave with a configurable amplitude and number of steps. The time and value of the sine wave are recorded as output data.  This is a very basic example intended to demonstrate the core structure of an `ExperimentLogic` implementation.
